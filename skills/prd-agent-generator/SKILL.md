# PRD Generator (Non-Interactive Mode)

Create detailed Product Requirements Documents that are clear, actionable, and suitable for implementation based solely on the user's initial input.

---

## The Job

1. Receive a feature description from the user
2. Analyze the input and make reasonable assumptions where details are missing
3. Generate a structured PRD based on the input

---

## Handling Ambiguity

When the user's input lacks specific details:

- **Make reasonable assumptions** based on common patterns and best practices
- **Document assumptions** in the PRD under "Assumptions Made"
- **Flag critical unknowns** in the "Open Questions" section
- **Err on the side of MVP scope** when scope is unclear
- **Default to standard patterns** (e.g., CRUD operations, standard UI components)

---

## PRD Structure

Generate the PRD with these sections:

### 1. Introduction/Overview
Brief description of the feature and the problem it solves.

### 2. Assumptions Made
List key assumptions made due to missing details in the original request:
- "Assumed target users are [X] based on feature context"
- "Assumed MVP scope since no specific scope mentioned"
- "Assumed standard authentication is already in place"

### 3. Goals
Specific, measurable objectives (bullet list).

### 4. User Stories
Each story needs:
- **Title:** Short descriptive name
- **Description:** "As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]"
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Verifiable checklist of what "done" means

Each story should be small enough to implement in one focused session.

**Format:**
```markdown
### US-001: [Title]
**Description:** As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit].

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Specific verifiable criterion
- [ ] Another criterion
- [ ] Typecheck/lint passes
- [ ] **[UI stories only]** Verify in browser using dev-browser skill
```

**Important:** 
- Acceptance criteria must be verifiable, not vague. "Works correctly" is bad. "Button shows confirmation dialog before deleting" is good.
- **For any story with UI changes:** Always include "Verify in browser using dev-browser skill" as acceptance criteria. This ensures visual verification of frontend work.

### 5. Functional Requirements
Numbered list of specific functionalities:
- "FR-1: The system must allow users to..."
- "FR-2: When a user clicks X, the system must..."

Be explicit and unambiguous.

### 6. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
What this feature will NOT include. Critical for managing scope.

### 7. Design Considerations (Optional)
- UI/UX requirements
- Link to mockups if available
- Relevant existing components to reuse

### 8. Technical Considerations (Optional)
- Known constraints or dependencies
- Integration points with existing systems
- Performance requirements

### 9. Success Metrics
How will success be measured?
- "Reduce time to complete X by 50%"
- "Increase conversion rate by 10%"

### 10. Open Questions
Remaining questions or areas needing clarification. This is where you document:
- Critical unknowns that affect implementation
- Areas where the original request was ambiguous
- Decisions that may need stakeholder input

## Writing for Junior Developers

The PRD reader may be a junior developer or AI agent. Therefore:

- Be explicit and unambiguous
- Avoid jargon or explain it
- Provide enough detail to understand purpose and core logic
- Number requirements for easy reference
- Use concrete examples where helpful

---

## Output

- **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)

---

## Example PRD

```markdown
# PRD: Task Priority System

## Introduction

Add priority levels to tasks so users can focus on what matters most. Tasks can be marked as high, medium, or low priority, with visual indicators and filtering to help users manage their workload effectively.

## Assumptions Made

- Assumed this is for an existing task management system with a tasks table
- Assumed standard web UI (not mobile app)
- Assumed MVP scope - basic priority features without advanced automation
- Assumed users are familiar with priority systems from other tools

## Goals

- Allow assigning priority (high/medium/low) to any task
- Provide clear visual differentiation between priority levels
- Enable filtering and sorting by priority
- Default new tasks to medium priority

## User Stories

### US-001: Add priority field to database
**Description:** As a developer, I need to store task priority so it persists across sessions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Add priority column to tasks table: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low' (default 'medium')
